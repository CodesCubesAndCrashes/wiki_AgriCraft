AgriCraft, while at first glance appears a simple mod, contains multiple terminologies that are important to get correct as to understand the mod in its entirety.

The most confusing of these terminologies is the difference between 'mutation' and 'cross-breeding'.

## Cross-Breeding
Cross-Breeding involves the breeding of two plants of the same species, to produce a child plant of that same species.

## Mutation
A mutation is the hybridization of two plants together to form a new species of plant.

## Plant
A plant is something that may be grown in a crop.

## Crop
A crop is a special block that aids in the growing of plants. It is not a plant itself, but rather a plant container.
This is an issue of confusion as the word crop is often used as a synonym for plant.
