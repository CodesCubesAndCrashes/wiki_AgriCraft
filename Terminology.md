AgriCraft, while at first glance appears a simple mod, contains multiple terminologies that are important to get correct as to understand the mod in its entirety.

The most confusing of these terminologies is the difference between 'mutation' and 'cross-breeding'.

## Cross-Breeding
Cross-Breeding involves the breeding of two plants of the same species, to produce a child plant of that same species.

## Mutation
A mutation is the hybridization of two plants together to form a new species of plant.

## Plant
A plant is something that may be grown in a crop.

## Crop
A crop is a special block that aids in the growing of plants. It is not a plant itself, but rather a plant container.
This is an issue of confusion as the word crop is often used as a synonym for plant.

## Chance
A chance is a decimal number in the range from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 represents that an event will never occur, and 1.0 represents that an event will always occur. *Note:* Sometimes this term will be mixed up with the concept of a weight.

## Weight
A weight is a decimal number in the range from 0.0 to 1.0, which represents the relative probability of the event occurring relative to the sum of all possible weighted events. That being said, if there is only a single event that can occur, then it will always occur.

A typical example of weighting would be if one had two events, A and B, both with a weight of 0.5. Henceforth, the total weight of all elements is 1.0, making the probability of event A equal to `0.5 [A's weight] / 1.0 [Total Weight] = 0.5` or `50%`.
