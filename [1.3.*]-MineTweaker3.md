## CustomWood recipes

CustomWood recipes are the recipes for the Channel, Tank and Valve. These are like vanilla recipes with the only difference that for each plank type a seperate recipe is created.

Import: `import mods.agricraft.CustomWood`

### Provided methods 

- `remove(IItemStack result)`: Removes all recipes for crafting `result`
- `addShaped(IItemStack result, IItemStack[][] inputs)`
- `addShapeless(IItemStack result, IItemStack[] inputs)`

### Example

    import mods.agricraft.CustomWood;

    CustomWood.remove(<AgriCraft:waterChannel>);
    CustomWood.addShaped(<AgriCraft:waterChannel>,
        [[<minecraft:planks>, null, <minecraft:planks>],
        [null, null, null],
        [null, <minecraft:planks>, null]]);

    CustomWood.remove(<AgriCraft:channelValve>);
    CustomWood.addShapeless(<AgriCraft:channelValve>,
        [<AgriCraft:waterChannel>, <AgriCraft:waterChannel>, <minecraft:stick>])

This example will change the recipe for all Channel and Valve versions. Note that the `<minecraft:planks>` in the shaped recipe and the `<AgriCraft:waterChannel>` in the shapeless recipe, will get replaced with the "correct" instance for all the recipes.

## Seed Mutations

Seed mutations are of the general form `<result> = <parent1> + <parent2>`. Additional parameters can further refine the mutation. Not all possibilities are exposed via MineTweaker (yet).

Import: `import mods.agricraft.SeedMutation`

### Provided methods

- `remove(IItemStack result)`: Removes all mutations where `<result>` is the result of the mutation.
- `add(IItemStack result, IItemStack parent1, IItemStack parent2)`

### Example

    import mods.agricraft.SeedMutation;

    SeedMutation.remove(<minecraft:pumpkin_seeds>);
    SeedMutation.add(<minecraft:pumpkin_seeds>, <minecraft:melon_seeds>, <minecraft:wheat_seeds>);


## Seed blacklist

Seeds on the blacklist can **not** be planted on crops. Make sure that all provided method arguments 
are of type `ItemSeeds`.

Import: `import mods.agricraft.SeedBlacklist`

### Provided methods

- `add(IItemStack seed)`
- `add(IItemStack[] seeds)`
- `remove(IItemStack seed)`
- `remove(IItemStack[] seeds)`

### Example

    import mods.agricraft.SeedBlacklist;

    SeedBlacklist.add([<minecraft:pumpkin_seeds>, <minecraft:melon_seeds>]);

## Spread chance

The spread chance of individual seeds can be overwritten. The spread chance denotes the probability that a fully grown fruit will spread to an adjecent cross-breed crop.

Import: `import mods.agricraft.SpreadChance`

### Provided methods

- `override(IItemStack seed, int chance)`: Chance has to be between `0` and `100` inclusive.


## Custom crop fruits

You can change the fruits dropped by custom crops by adding/removing drops

Import: `import mods.agricraft.CropProduct`

### Provided methods

- `add(IItemStack seed, IItemStack fruit, int weight)`: seed is the seed corresponding to the crop, weight has to be higher than zero, else the default value of 10 will be used
- `remove(IItemStack seed, IItemStack fruit)

# Growth requirements

This section contains all the available configuration objects which modify growth requirements

## Fertile soils

Fertile soils are the default soils if no custom soil is specified. Make sure that all provided
method arguments are of type `ItemBlock`.

Import: `import mods.agricraft.growing.FertileSoils`

### Provided methods

- `add(IItemStack soil)`
- `add(IItemStack[] soils)`
- `remove(IItemStack soil)`
- `remove(IItemStack[] soils)`


## Soil

Allows to define a specific soil for a specific plant. This mechanism is used by default to restrict sugarcane and cactus to sand.

Import: `import mods.agricraft.growing.Soil`

### Provided methods

- `set(IItemStack seed, IItemStack soil)`
- `clear(IItemStack seed)`: Removes the specific soil requirement. Seed can be planted on all fertile soils.


## Brightness

Allows to define the light levels at which the plant can grow. The user has to specify an interval for this setting: [a, b[ where 0 <= a <= b < 16. (Note that the lower bound is inclusive and the upper bound exclusive)

Import: `import mods.agricraft.growing.Brightness`

### Provided methods

- `set(IItemStack seed, int min, int max)`


## BaseBlock

The base block is a block that has to be either **below** or **nearby** (range 4) of the soil where the seed is planted on.

Import: `import mods.agricraft.growing.BaseBlock`

### Provided methods
- `set(IItemStack seed, IItemStack base, int type)`
- `set(IIOreDictEntry seed, IItemStack base, int type)`
- `set(IItemStack seed, IItemStack base, int type, boolean baseBlockOreDicted)`
    - `type` is either `1` (BELOW) or `2` (NEARBY)
    - `baseBlockOreDicted` should be `true` if every block with the same ore dict should fulfill the requirement, `false` otherwise
- `clear(IItemStack seed)`: Removes the requirement of a base block from the seed
