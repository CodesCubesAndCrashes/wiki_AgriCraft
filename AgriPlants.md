AgriCraft 2.0.0 introduces an exciting new feature: **JSON Custom Plants**!

JSON Custom Plants (i.e. AgriPlants) allow for total control of your agricultural experience, and even work in multiplayer environments!

This page will serve as a guide to using this awesome new feature of AgriCraft!

## Note
The JSON file may be located in any folder under the `config\agricraft\json\default` directory. Furthermore, the file must end in with `_plant.json` so that for a plant like wheat, the file name would be `wheat_plant.json`. This requirement is made so that the JSON file loader can differentiate between the different JSON file types.
